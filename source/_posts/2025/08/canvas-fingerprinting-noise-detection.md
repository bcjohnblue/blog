## Introduction

Canvas fingerprinting is a powerful technique for detecting fraudsters and bots. This presentation explores how attackers modify canvas fingerprints to evade detection and the methods we can use to identify these manipulations.

## What is Canvas Fingerprinting?

[Canvas fingerprinting](https://jsfiddle.net/piotrbartnik/dppqhtg3/1/) uses the HTML canvas API to draw invisible shapes and text that create unique identifiers based on your:

- Browser

- Operating system

- GPU

- Installed fonts

These fingerprints are stable and unique, making them valuable for tracking fraudsters even if they delete cookies.
